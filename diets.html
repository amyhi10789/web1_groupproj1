            <h3> What are diets?</h3>
            <p>A diet is the kind of food a person usually eats every day. It includes what foods you choose, how much you eat, and how often you eat them. Some people follow special diets to stay healthy, lose weight, or for medical or cultural reasons. A balanced diet includes foods from all the main food groups, giving your body the nutrients it needs to grow, stay strong, and have energy. Eating a healthy diet helps you feel your best and supports long-term health.</p>

            <h3> How to have a balanced diet</h3>
            <p> A balanced diet means eating the right amounts of different types of food to keep your body strong and healthy. It includes fruits and vegetables for vitamins, grains for energy, protein foods like eggs, beans, or meat for growth, and dairy for strong bones. Drinking plenty of water and limiting sugary or fried foods also helps. When your meals have a mix of colors and food groups, you are giving your body everything it needs to feel its best.</p>
