    <h3> What are eating habits?</h3>
    <p> Eating habits are the ways people choose and enjoy their food every day. They include what foods we eat, how much we eat, and when we eat. Our eating habits can be shaped by our family, culture, emotions, and daily routines. Good eating habits help our bodies stay healthy, give us energy, and support growth, while unhealthy habits can lead to tiredness or health problems. Learning to make smart food choices is an important part of living a healthy life.

        <h3>Good eating habits</h3>
        <p>Good eating habits help you stay healthy, active, and full of energy. They include eating a variety of foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy every day. Itâ€™s also important to eat regular meals, avoid skipping breakfast, and drink plenty of water. Eating slowly and stopping when you feel full helps your body know when it has enough food. Choosing healthy snacks instead of junk food and eating with family or friends can also make meals more enjoyable and balanced.</p>

        <h3>Bad eating habits</h3>
        <p>Bad eating habits are choices that can harm your health over time. These include skipping meals, eating too much junk food or sugar, and drinking lots of soda instead of water. Eating too fast, eating while watching TV, or eating even when you are not hungry are also unhealthy habits. These behaviors can lead to tiredness, weight gain, or other health problems. Changing small things like eating balanced meals and paying attention to what you eat can make a big difference in how you feel every day.</p>
